Oops…

Pearl, are you okay?

Pearl?

Pearl, lie on the floor unconscious if you’re okay…

Yay… That means she’s okay…

Snap out of it Molly. Where are the ingredients we would need to reverse my spell?

The Sea of Lapallas,
The Forest in Katalan,
The Volcano at Gatoros. 

I can do this…

Look out Pearl, Molly isn’t just the witch who knocked you out cold (while also knocking over your favorite antique clock, smashing it to bits) she’s also the witch who is going to save your life!

Go Molly, Through the Portal—

No Molly, no time for a theme song now! Hum it in your head while you save Pearl’s life!!
